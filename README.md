# CNN-Image-Recognition

In this notebook I used Tensorflow to build a Convolution Neural Network that classifies images from [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) which contains images of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects.

NOTE: If you are prompted to select a kernel when you launch a notebook, choose the Python 3kernel.
